          <h3>The Hackathon</h3>
          <p>
              During a Hackathon of 48 hours , alot of young talented IT students were locked in the buidings of ING, with the task of developing an app that fits in the philosophy of the bank: allow people to be a step for in life and in business.
          </p>
          <p>
              The youngsters, divided into 12 teams, showed their creativity and customer focus. Some teams focused on the social role played by the bank and its clients, other teams were looking for innovative payment solutions or new ways in which the bank can help entrepreneurs in financing or start up their business. 
          </p>
         
          <h3>Our project of this Hackathon</h3>
          <p>
              Payments are to difficult. When you receive a bill, you have to type over the bank account number, and all other data manually. This process takes to much time. When you've typed everything, you also need a token generator to confirm your payment. A lot of work, just for a simple payment. 
          </p>
          <p>
              We want to ease up this process by adding a QR code on every bill. When you scan this QR code with you smartphone, all the payment data is automatically filled in on your smartphone. The only thing you need to do is check and sign the payment. To speed up the signment procedure we've added facial recognition to our app to sign a payment. Just point your smartphoneâ€™s camera to your face, and the payment is signed. 
          </p>
          <p>
              All this was implemented on Andriod and iOS using Xamarin during the 48 hours Hackathon.
