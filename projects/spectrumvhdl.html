          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            This project contains an audio spectrum analyzer written in VHDL and synthesizable for a Xilinx Zynq 7000. The development board used to build this project is a ZedBoard.
          </p>
          <p>
            The audio spectrum analyzer takes a stereo audio as input, then calculates the spectrum trough a fast Fourrier transform (FFT). This spectrum is then shown on a HDMI or VGA compatible screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user has the possibility to make some preferences (different themes, averaging...) by using the buttons on te ZedBoard.
          </p>

          <h3>General workflow</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>An audio signal is applied to the line input of the ZedBoard.</li>

              <li>The audio signal is sampled trough an audio codec (ADAU1761).</li>

              <li>The audio signal is decoded by an I2S decoder.</li>

              <li>A RAM memory is filled with 1024 audio samples. Each sample consists of 16-bit audio data per channel.</li>

              <li>When the audio sample memory is completely filled, the samples will be multiplied with a hamming window. This is done separately for each channel.</li>

              <li>The audio samples are then supplied to the FFT engine. This engine reads 1024 samples before the transformation begins.</li>

              <li>When the transformation is finished, the samples are stored in a (block) RAM. The 512 samples are scaled to a width of 1280 pixels to fit on a HD screen.</li>

              <li>Finally, the image generation logic will generate an image depending on the switches. This picture is then send to the HDMI and VGA interface of the ZedBoard.</li>

              <li>On the ZedBoard OLED screen some aditional data about the user settings is shown. This project contains also a driver for the ZedBoard OLED screen completely written in VHDL.</li>
