          <h3>The expo</h3>
          <p>
              WetenschapsExpo Sciences is a science contest for students between 6 and 20 years old. During a 2 day expo all teams present their scientific or technical project to the public. WetenschapsExpo Sciences offers young students the opportunity to show their results to the general public, experts in the matter and to their peers.In this way they do not only develop their scientific and technical knowledge, but also their presentation and communication skills.

          <h3>The project</h3>
          <p>
              In this project we've created a proof of concept (prototype) of a regular AA battery sourrounded with flexible solar cells that was able to reload itself when it was exposed to the sun. Due to the limited resources we've got, we created a large scale model of this battery to prove the concept.
