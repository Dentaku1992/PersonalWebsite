          <h3>The expo</h3>
          <p>
              WetenschapsExpo Sciences is a science contest for students between 6 and 20 years old. During a 2 day expo all teams present their scientific or technical project to the public. WetenschapsExpo Sciences offers young students the opportunity to show their results to a wide audience, experts in the field and to their peers. In this way they do not only develop their scientific and technical knowledge, but also their presentation and communication skills.

          <h3>The project</h3>
          <p>
              In this project we've created a proof of concept (prototype) of a regular AA-battery. This battery is surrounded with flexible solar cells and able to reload itself when it is exposed to the sun. Due to the limited resources we've got, we created a large scale model of this battery to prove the concept.
