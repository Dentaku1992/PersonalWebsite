            <h3>The expo</h3>
            <p>
             WetenschapsExpo Sciences is a science contest for students between 6 and 20 years old. During a 2 day expo all teams present their scientific or technical project to the public. WetenschapsExpo Sciences offers young students the opportunity to show their results to a wide audience, experts in the field and to their peers. In this way they do not only develop their scientific and technical knowledge, but also their presentation and communication skills.

            <h3>The project</h3>
            <p>
              In our project e-school we've created a proof of concept for a new digital learning environment. It’s a system, based upon the idea of the digitalising of schoolbooks, that is capable of reducing the weight of an average backpack and increasing the usage comfort of courses on school dramatically. By the enormous possibilities of this system a great deal of side information can be given without the usage of for example overhead projectors or beamers. 
            </p>

            <p>
              E-school provides also a digital version of the calculator. This is not system related so it will be possible to adjust it if the school pleases. The teacher can block it or call up a log file of the executed actions at testing if necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
              What is the content of this project? </br>
              Each student and teacher will have to own a laptop that must be connected to a server with the internet. Then the user can log in and use the functions of e-school. The standard functions of e-school are the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Backpack: This is a collection of digital courses and all side information, so the students are capable of choosing free out of these courses and have the possibility of making summaries and eventually printing these.
                </li>

                <li>
                  LiveShow: LiveShow is what we call a newer digital version of the old overhead projector. This application makes showing photos, movies, schedules and a lot more possible during class. The files that are used are showed on the screens of the students but these can’t be saved without permission.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Graphical Calculator: Also of the calculator there will be a digital version recorded into e-school. This is not system bound so it will be possible to be adjusted if the school pleases. If wanted the teacher can block this or call up a log file of the executed actions at testing.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Valven: This is the news page of the school. All the classroom amendments, activities and announcements will be reported in this function. The most recent announcements will be showed on the main screen of e-school.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              <p>
                In addition to these applications, an agenda and a mailbox where the teachers can mail the students announcements and assignments, will be implemented. There will be extra features like a covering function that can be used when studying or E-Notes for taking small notes. Also a self test department to see if you can master your knowledge, will be available.
              </p>

              <p>
                The advantages of e-school don’t stop at the wide variation of possibilities but they go much further. Due to our system, tons of paper will be saved. This results into reducing the school bill. On the other hand, renting textbooks, buying or renting calculators and buying workbooks will still be necessary. For the price of all this material, we can buy a laptop of mediocre quality with licences of courses and programs.
              </p>

              <p>
                In contrast to a lot of other similar methods, this one is much more expanded and the classes are dependent upon this technology. This is a disadvantage of e-school: the increasing dependency on technology. This idea fits perfectly into the 21st century, but still we rely on the vagaries of technology and the electricity. Also handwriting will be neglected although taking notes will remain. Anyway, e-school is the system that renews education, improves and prepares it for the 21st century.
