              WetenschapsExpo Sciences is a science contest for students between 6 and 20 years old. During a 2 day expo all teams present their scientific or technical project to the public. WetenschapsExpo Sciences offers young students the opportunity to show their results to the general public, experts in the matter and to their peers.In this way they do not only develop their scientific and technical knowledge, but also their presentation and communication skills.

              In our project e-school we've created a proof of concept for a new digital learning environment. It’s a system, based upon the idea of the digitalising of schoolbooks, that is capable of reducing the weight of an average backpack and increasing the usage comfort of courses on school dramatically. By the enormous possibilities of this system a great deal of side information can be given without the usage of for example overhead projectors or beamers. 
            </p>

            <p>
              E-school is available for school as well for home usage, After school our students can take home their laptops so they can consult the digital work- and textbooks. With an internet connection you have the possibility of receiving new updates or news of the school. 
            </p>

            <p>
              What is the content of this project? </br>
              Each student and teacher will have to own a laptop that must be connected to a server with the internet. Then the user can log in and use the functions of e-school. The standard functions of e-school are the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Backpack: This is a collection of digital courses and all side information so the students are capable of choosing free out of these courses and have the possibility of making summary’s and eventually printing these off
                </li>

                <li>
                  LiveShow: LiveShow is what we call a newer digital version of the old overhead projector. This application makes showing photos, movies, schedules and a lot more doable during class. The files that are used are showed on the screens of the students but these can’t be saved without permission.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Graphical Calculator:  Also of the calculator there will be a digital version recorded into e-school. This is not system bound so it will be possible to be adjusted if the school pleases. If wanted the teacher can block this or call up a log file of the executed actions at testing.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Valven: This is the news page of the school. Here all the classroom switches, activities and announcements will be reported. The most recent announcements will be showed onto the main screen of e-school.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              <p>
                Next these applications there will also be an agenda implanted and a mailbox were the teachers can mail the students announcements and assignments. Also there will be extra features like a covering function that can be used when studying or E-Notes for taking small notes and a self test department to see if you can master your knowledge.
              </p>

              <p>
                The advantages of e-school don’t stop at the wide variation of possibilities but they go much further . By our system tons of paper will be saved that results into dropping of the school bill. But this will still be expected of us: renting textbooks, buying or renting calculators and buying workbooks. For the price of all this materials we can buy a laptop of mediocre quality with licences of courses and programs.
              </p>

              <p>
                In opposition to a lot of other similar methods this one is much more expanded and the classes are dependent upon this technology. This is also a disadvantage of e-school, the increasing dependency on technology. This idea fits perfectly into the 21st century but still we rely on the vagaries of technology and the electricity. Also handwriting will be neglected although taking notes will be needed. How it happens, e-school is the system that renews education, improves and prepares education for the 21st century.
