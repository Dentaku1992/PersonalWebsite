          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
             My master thesis consisted of the design of a bracelet for monitoring medical parameters supporting Bluetooth Low Energy. In this thesis, I created a first prototype of a bracelet to measure some important health parameters like heartbeat, body temperature... The bracelet was communicating with a smartphone application (created with Xamarin) via the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. This thesis was done in cooperation with Nick Steen and Televic Healthcare.

          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            This master thesis deals with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy communication between a sensortag bracelet and a smartphone or gateway. This sensortag is a bracelet equipped with a varity of sensors. The main goal of this bracelet is to stimulate the longer stay at home for the elderly and home rehabilitation after surgery. After examining many possibilities in the wide range of available sensors on the market, the most suitable sensors for monitoring various vital parameters were chosen.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these parameters are checked for validity and reliability (is it possible to measure this parameter through a bracelet). Then the measured values ​​are transmitted trough the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The smart phone or gateway is capable, if desired, to send the collected data to third parties. The power consumption of the bracelet is very important. The goal is to minimize this power consumption as much as possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In a first part of this thesis, a study of Bluetooth Low Energy technology is performed: Is this technology suitable for the connection between the sensortag bracelet and a smartphone or gateway? The following two cases are examined:

          <ul>
            <li>
              On the one hand it is investigated if the Bluetooth Low Energy technology meets the requirements to transmit private data in a secure and reliable way. This data consists of the measured values ​​of the different sensors available in the sensortag. 
            </li>
            <li>
              On the other hand, the minimization of the power consumption is examined.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Saving power is not limited to the sensortag itself, but it should be extended to the application on the smartphone. By limiting or shortening the exchange of information the power can be minimized. This is possible through the correct usage of the GATT and ATT methods provided by the Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Power saving is achieved by a correct setup of the transmit power, the advertising intervals and the connection parameters. By adapting these parameters realtime to the actual situation, even more power can be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second study focuses on the presence of appropriate sensors within the current market offerings. To get an idea of ​​the availability of sensors in the current range which are suitable in the medical field, a selection of sensors are tested to examine which sensors meets the requirements for reliability, power consumption, form factor...
        </p>
        <p>
          The availability of medical sensors in the current range is limited. Often there are  high-accuracy sensors available, but it's difficult to make a reliable measurement at the position where the sensortag is located on the body, particularly around the wrist. The mentioned accuracy is often in ideal conditions, which in reality rarely can be achieved. Because of this it is still necessary to make a human judgment of the measured value.
