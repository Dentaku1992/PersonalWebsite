              WetenschapsExpo Sciences is a science contest for students between 6 and 20 years old. During a 2 day expo all teams present their scientific or technical project to the public. WetenschapsExpo Sciences offers young students the opportunity to show their results to the general public, experts in the matter and to their peers.In this way they do not only develop their scientific and technical knowledge, but also their presentation and communication skills.

              Our project consists of two parts. On the one hand, we have held a survey about global warming and the environment with the main objective to find out if people are aware of the problem of global warming. On the other hand, we want to inform those people who are not aware of this global problem. We also provide some environmental tips and solutions you can apply at home.

              In order to illustrate global warming, we have built a city model. In our model, greenhouse gases are represented by plates in acrylic glass. During our experiments we have measured temperature with and without greenhouse gases. The temperature difference was considerable, which indicates that the presence of greenhouse gases has a big impact.
