              On Wednesday, March 4th of 2009, the first Flemish programming contest took place, attended by more then 130 students, both high school students and students from universities from all over Flanders. The contest was organized by the Department of Computer Science of K.U.Leuven university, in collaboration with four other Flemish universities. Participants were given three hours to program as much missions as they could.

              As the only participating team (team e-school) of a secondary school we end up on the sixth place, with as much right solutions as the first team.
