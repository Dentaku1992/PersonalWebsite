          <h3>The contest</h3>
          <p>
              On Wednesday, March 4th of 2009, the first Flemish programming contest took place, attended by more than 130 students, both high school students and students from universities all over Flanders. The contest was organized by the Department of Computer Science of K.U.Leuven university, in collaboration with four other Flemish universities. Participants were given three hours to program as much missions as they could.

              We ended up in sixth place with as many right answers as the winner, although we were the only participating team (team e-school) of a secondary school!
