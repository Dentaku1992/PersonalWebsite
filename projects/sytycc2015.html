          <h3>The Hackathon</h3>
          <p>
              During a Hackathon of 48 hours, 38 young talented IT students were locked in the buidings of ING, with the task of developing an app that fits in the philosophy of the bank: allow people to be a step ahead in life and in business.
          </p>
          <p>
              The 38 youngsters, divided into 10 teams, showed their creativity and customer focus. Some teams focused on the social role played by the bank and its clients, other teams were looking for innovative payment solutions or new ways in which the bank can help entrepreneurs in financing or start up their business.

          <h3>Our project of this Hackathon</h3>
          <p>
              Nowadays life can't be imagined without smartphones. The first thing in the morning I hear is the alarmclock set on my smartphone. At dawn of day, I have a quick look at my mails, catch up with the news and spend some time on Facebook. Obviously I don't have enough time left for a proper breakfast because I have to catch my train. Arriving at the station there's just enough time to grab a quick coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
              While I am waiting my turn, an idea stikes me! Why do I have to wait this long for my coffee? I lose a lot of time in the queue. On top of that, I always have to struggle through my coins to pay my coffee while making it only takes little time. Wouldn't it be more relaxing if I could just walk in the station, get my coffee and get on my train. No further hassle!
          </p>
          <p>
              Or can you see yourself in this: getting back from a stressful day at work. Thinking by yourself that a drink would be nice, you realize that you just spend your change on that cause at work. Imagine a world where your smartphone pays!
          </p>
          <p>
              In English one would call it 'paying the small things with a smart device'. In geek we would say, thanks to modern technologies as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the rising Internet of Things (IoT) one is able to pay the casual things with the most common tool known to mankind.
          </p>
          <p>
              Smart vending machines would improve the whole concept of daily life. By adding BLE functionality to every vending machine, customers could order a product from anywhere, and collect their goods whenever they are close to the vending machine.
          </p>
          <p>
              It also enables vendors to manage their stock in a much more flexible and adaptive way! In a time where people try to avoid having change on them, this is the ideal answer. With the use of modern big data algorithms vendors can do very specific and personal advertising. People on a diet would only see things they would like to buy. The system could automaticaly respond to a change in consumption. Vending machines would be part of a contemporary world where people share their experiences on social media. And we will not only limit to vending machines, also coffeshops at train stations, kiosks and all other shops where you have to order something.
          </p>
          <p>
              To conclude, this is the marketing of tomorrow. This is the client vendor model of the future. The future invites us to make it into a stressless and peaceful environment!
