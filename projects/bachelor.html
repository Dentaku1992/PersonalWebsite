        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
           In this thesis, I designed a flying wing unmanned aerial vehicle for search and rescue operations above the Belgian North Sea. A mock of the complete electrical system was build as well. This thesis was done in cooperation with VLOC Ostend.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            The flying wing is a rarely  type of plane in aviation and therefore a plane that captures the imagination of many people, partly because the use of flying wings is primarily military oriented. It's difficult to obtain the design of a flying wing, and even more difficult the design of an unmanned flying wing. Therefore, in this thesis we've tried to write out a step by step design process for the design of a flying wing UAV that takes into account the limitations of both, the flying wings and unmanned aircrafts.

          <p>
            The goal is not the design of an everyday unmanned flying wing, but the design of an unmanned flying wing that has the capabilities of a quick intervention plane for operations above the North Sea. With a high availability and a high cruising speed the flying wing can be used when searching for drowning victims, conducting measurements in high risk areas (nuclear disaster) or detecting forest fires. In short, a machine with many possibilities where one thing is common ground, the rapid deployment.

            The design process that was used consists out of three essential steps: conceptual, preliminary and detailed design. The requirements for the conceptual design, were given as an input by the KHBO. So the concept was to design a flying wing, powered by an electric ducted fan engine. During the second step, the preliminary design, a preliminary study was done to flying wings and unmanned aerial vehicles. This research gave an idea of ​​the usual relations between flying wings and unmanned aerial vehicles. Next, a mathematical model has been designed as the basis for a first 3D model. During the last phase, the detailed design, all components and systems have been developed in detail. For all components a technical drawing was made. The design was verified by the final result to assess the specific requirements and expectations.
